# Laplacian Eigenvector Visualizer
The Laplacian matrix of a graph is a useful matrix. We can interpret it as an operator taking an assignment of real numbers on the nodes of the graph (= a vector), and assigning to each node the sum of the differences between its and its neighbor's values. Hence the Laplacian matrix encodes the way functions on nodes of graphs behave with respect to the graph structure.

The eigenvectors of Laplacian matrices are also useful. Because the Laplacian is symmetric and positive semi-definite, its eigenvectors are real and its eigenvalues are non-negative. If we ignore the null eigenvector $\langle 1, \dots, 1\rangle$, we can take the eigenvector corresponding to the second-smallest eigenvalue (the [Fiedler vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_connectivity#Fiedler_vector)); quantizing the coefficients of this eigenvector to -1 or 1 gives us a good approximation of the [sparsest cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(graph_theory)#Sparsest_cut) of the graph. Laplacian matrix eigenvectors also appear implicitly as a basis in graph neural networks.

This repo consists of a single three.js scene for constructing graphs and visualizing their eigenvectors.
